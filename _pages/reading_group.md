We are organising a biweekly meeting to discuss recent studies.
The contents include exciting and cutting-edge papers, blogs, and even codes.
And you are *encouraged* to interrupt the speaker to ask questions anytime during the talk.

We hold this event at SUDA's main campus.
It may become an online meetup if there are exceptional circumstances.

If you are interested in sharing and willing to give a talk, please <a href="mailto:tzhu1997@outlook.com?subject=Appling for giving a talk">email us</a>.
